wbmtranslator is the translation assistant for Webmin / Usermin modules. It allows Webmin / Usermin translators to have a global view of current translations for all registered modules and themes, including the web interface and configuration screens. They can accurately track changes, create or update translations, send them to the Webmin team, and more.

## Installation

Use the Webmin modules manager to install it after creating a gzipped tarball archive of the main repository :
```bash
tar zcvf wbmtranslator.wbm.gz wbmtranslator/
```
