		  on the way Webmin is writing his log-files.
		  
		  Jamie Cameron:
		  "[...] Fortunately, this isn't really a problem, as Webmin 
		  always stores the logs internally in an english-like format, 
		  which is converted to the user's native language only for 
		  display. If you look at /var/webmin/webmin.log, you can see 
		  this internal format which could be copied to any system 
		  regardless of language configured - so if someone wanted to 
		  send me logs for debugging, they could send that file rather
		  than a screen dump of the Webmin Actions Log module.
		  The log_* strings are used only for converting this file for
		  display, and are not stored in the file directly. [...]"

		- Removed 1 line:
			- trans_log_entries
