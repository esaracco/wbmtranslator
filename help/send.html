<header>Send E-Mail</header>

This section helps you to send out an E-Mail with the updated translation or lets you download your work for later usage.
<p>
In order to make proper use of this section you'll need to edit the 'Module Config' of the Translation Assistant with the following data:
<ul>
<li><b>Your E-Mail-Adress</b> which is needed to get a valid sender adress in case someone needs to contact you regarding your work.</li>
<li><b>SMTP Host</b> which is needed to send out an E-Mail anyway.</li>
<li><b>Webmin traduction team E-Mail-Adress</b> to send in official updates to the Webmin-Core-Team</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of the time you want to set &quot;SMTP Host&quot; to 'localhost' if you are on a unixoid system regardless what SMTP-Server is installed on your system. SMTP-Authentification is not possible at this time.
<p>
In order to send in updates officially you want to set the recipient address to &lt;translations@webmin.com&gt; so that your work can be put into the main Webmin-Software. Be prepared that if you do not use a valid entry in &quot;Your E-Mail&quot; your updates are declined. If you leave this line blank this module defaults to &lt;translations@webmin.com&gt;.
<p>
Most of the times you only want to send in updates for your language and not for all. Please pick the right one from the list.
<p>
<b>Important Notice:</b>&nbsp;Some Linux-Distributors (Mandrake as example) are filling their Webmin-Packages with more modules which are not in the main Webmin-Software-Package.<u>Please send in updates for those modules to the persons who are responsible for those modules.</u>.

A complete list of Webmin-Standard-Modules can be found here:<br>

If you are still unsure, please contact &lt;translations@webmin.com&gt; <b>before</b> sending in stuff and give proper info where you find the module, so that good assistance is possible.
