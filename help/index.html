<header>Translation assistant</header>

<p>The Translation assistant allows the Webmin/Usermin translators to have a global sight of the translations in progress for all the recorded modules and themes, including the Web Interface as well as the configuration screens.</p>

<p>Please, <b>only translate against the latest Development-Version of Webmin</b> in order to avoid double work. If you intend to send in your update officially to the Webmin-Translators-Team it otherwise may be refused without any notice.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that not all modules are viewable in wbmtranslator. wbmtranslator actually shows only modules, which can be used by your system.</p>
