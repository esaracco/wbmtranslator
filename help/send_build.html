<header>Share translations via E-Mail</header>

<p>This section helps you to send out an E-Mail with the updated translation or lets you download your work for later usage.</p>

<p>In order to make proper use of this section you'll need to edit the configuration of wbmtranslator with the following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Your E-Mail-Adress</b> which is needed to get a valid sender adress in case someone needs to contact you regarding your work.</li>
  <li><b>SMTP Host</b> which is needed to send out an E-Mail anyway.</li>
  <li><b>Webmin traduction team E-Mail-Adress</b> to send in official updates to the Webmin-Core-Team</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time you want to set <b>SMTP Host</b> to <code>localhost</code> if you are on a POSIX system regardless what SMTP-Server is installed on your system. SMTP-Authentification is not possible at this time.</p>

<p>In order to send in updates officially you want to set the recipient address to &lt;translations@webmin.com&gt; so that your work can be put into the main Webmin-Software. Be prepared that if you do not use a valid entry in <b>Your E-Mail</b> your updates are declined. If you leave this line blank this module defaults to &lt;translations@webmin.com&gt;.</p>

<p>Most of the times you only want to send in updates for your language and not for all. Please pick the right one from the list.</p>
